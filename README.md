# AsusRouter Emulator

AsusRouter Emulator (further, `ARE`) is a full-scale Python web application to emulate responses from the actual AsusWRT-powered devices. It is designed to be used for testing purposes and is a sibling project of [AsusRouter](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/asusrouter) Python library and [AsusRouter Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter).

## The idea

AsusWRT-powered devices (including those with AsusWRT-Merlin custom firmware) feature a full-scale HTTP(S) API to interact with the device (fetch system and clients data, change settings and run in-built services). `ARE` is built to emulate this API interactions with a specific device and FW version in mind to allow automated testing of the other projects.

## Features

... `ARE` is still in development and this repository will feature initial code and documentation as soon as it is ready ...

## Disclaimer

AsusRouter Emulator is a `free time project` (meaning its development and maintenance is voluntary decision of the author). `ARE` is not affiliated with ASUSTek Computer Inc. or its subsidiaries.

If you like `ARE` or any other of the AsusRouter open source projects I started and maintain, you can support me by buying a coffee.
